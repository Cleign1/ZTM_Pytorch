Welcome to my git repository where i will be writing some pytorch code alongside of ztm videos on udemy to try pytorch hands on

this repository is using pytorch 2.4.0 cuda 12.4 and has jupyter lab installed

to install, make sure you have an nvidia gpu with cuda 12.4
1. check cuda version using ```bash nvidia-smi``` and check the top right corner for cuda version
2. install nvidia cuda toolkit for your cuda version, mine has cuda 12.4 which you can get [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive)
3. clone this repository using ```bash git clone https://github.com/Cleign1/ZTM_Pytorch```
4. create a python virtual environtment using ```bash python -m venv venv```
5. enter the virual env for me ```bash venv\Scripts\activate```
7. install all of the requirement using ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt```
8. open via visual studio code or run jupyter lab via ```bash jupyter lab```
9. start experimenting !!!
